#X text 34 49 A declare object adds one or more directories to the
search path \, and/or pre-loads one or more libraries ("extensions")
to Pd in preparation for opening the patch from a file. Usage is "declare
[-flag value] [-flag value] ..." where the flag can be:, f 67;

#X text 30 560 BUG: The name "-stdpath" is confusing \, as it has a
quite different effect from "-stdpath" on the pd command line., f
68;
#X text 30 422 WARNING: as of version 0.47 \, "declare -path" and "declare
-stdpath" inside abstractions take effect only within those abstractions.
If Pd's compatibility version is set to 0.46 or earlier the old (buggy)
behavior takes effect., f 68;

#X text 128 134 add to search path \, relative to the patch or user
paths;
#X text 128 170 load a library \, relative to the patch or user paths
;
#X text 30 235 (For any of these you may use a full pathname such as
"/tmp/dir" or \, in Windows \, "C:/garbage" instead of a relative path).
, f 68;
#X text 30 488 As of version 0.49 \, "declare -path" and "declare -lib"
will fall back to user search paths if the relative path to the patch
does not exist. To avoid checking further \, use an explicit relative
path by prepending "./" or "../" to the path or lib name., f 68;
#X text 30 278 For instance \, if you put abstractions and/or other
supporting files in a subdirectory "more" \, you can put an object
"declare -path more" to make sure Pd sees them when the patch is loaded.
Or \, if you have files installed in the directory extra/stillmore
(in the Pd installation) you can get it using "declare -stdpath stillmore".

#X text 128 152 add to search path \, relative to Pd (the 'extra' folder)
;
#X text 128 187 load a library \, relative to Pd (the 'extra' folder)
;
#X text 30 357 Note that by default the 'extra' folder is the last
in the search priority. This means that user added paths are searched
before. You can use [declare -stdpath .] to ensure that 'extra' is
searched before other search paths., f 68;
